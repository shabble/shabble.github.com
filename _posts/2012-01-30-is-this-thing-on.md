`Hello, world!`

This is something that should look a bit like a blog entry, but isn't
actually. It's where a blog entry would go, if I could think of something
interesting to write about.  But I can't.

Hooray for [Jekyll]() and
[Jekyll Bootstrap](http://github.com/plusjade/jekyll-bootstrap)!

For reference, remember the useful
[quickstart](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/usage/jekyll-quick-start.html) guide.
